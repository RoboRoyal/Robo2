Left hydrophone is SPI 0
Right hydrophon is SPI 1
Center(down) hydrophone is not implimented

Arduino in USB port of PI 3 model B (any port)

Pinout for arduino(ARDUINO/GENUINO UNO REV3):
 * For IMU; Vcc=3.3, GND = ground, SDA = pin4, SCL = pin 5 (Analog)
 * For WaterSensor; Vcc=5, GND=ground, S=A0; >20uF cap and 20k ohm resistor between S and ground
 * For Motors; All are digital 'D'. Each pin should be a PWM with a "~" next to it
 * -Front Left = pin 3
 * -Front Right = pin 5
 * -Back Left = pin 6
 * -Back Right = pin 9
 * -Side Left = pin 10
 * -Side Right = pin 11
 * For depth sensor(not implimented)

 All should share same ground(nutral) and reference voltage (5V) with a >20uF cap over it
